Version of xoops
----------------
wgTestUI is a module that create other basic modules for CMS Xoops.

Tested with xoops 2.5.11, you can not use it with earlier versions, unless because you do not fit some core files in the background and after some tests.

Therefore recommended not to use wgTestUI with previous versions of XOOPS
